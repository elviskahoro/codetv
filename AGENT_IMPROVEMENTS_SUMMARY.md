    """Agent specialized for processing Awesome Lists and calling MCP servers"""
```

**After:**
```python
class AwesomeListAgent(Agent):
    """
    Awesome List Learning Path Agent
    
    This specialized agent transforms Awesome Lists into structured, personalized learning paths.
    It analyzes curated resource collections to extract key information, categorize content,
    and generate instructional guidance for effective learning.
    
    Key Capabilities:
    - Parse and analyze Awesome List repositories
    - Extract metadata, categories, and resource counts
    - Identify programming languages and technologies
    - Generate contextual summaries and learning recommendations
    - Provide structured learning path guidance
    
    The agent is designed to help developers navigate curated resource collections
    and create personalized learning journeys based on their interests and skill levels.

```python
def add_tool_span(
    self,
    tool_name: str,
    inputs: Dict[str, Any],
    outputs: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None,
    duration_ns: Optional[int] = None,
    success: bool = True,
    error: Optional[str] = None
) -> None:
    """Add a tool execution span with detailed JSON logging."""
    # Always log to fallback logger for visibility
    span_data = {
        "tool_name": tool_name,
        "inputs": self._sanitize_for_json(inputs),
        "outputs": self._sanitize_for_json(outputs) if outputs else None,

        "error": error,
        "duration_ns": duration_ns,
        "duration_ms": duration_ns / 1_000_000 if duration_ns else None
    }
    
    # Log the span data as JSON for clarity
    span_json = json.dumps(span_data, indent=2, ensure_ascii=False)
    self.fallback_logger.info(f"Tool Span: {tool_name}", span_data=span_json, **span_data)
```
